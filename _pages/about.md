Hello there! I'm Callum, a passionate data scientist and statistician at [Shell](https://www.shell.co.uk/) with a fascination for all things mathematics. My role at shell involves working at the confluence Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning, from exporing extreme values in climate data to constructing data and machine learning pipelines.

But when I'm not deciphering data patterns and unrevelling insights, you can find me seeking solace in the great outdoors. Fishing and surfing have become my passions, a perfect escape from the rigors of daily life.
