I'm Callum, a passionate data scientist at [Shell](https://www.shell.co.uk/) with a fascination for all things mathematics. My role at Shell involves working at the confluence of Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning, from exploring extreme values in our climate to constructing data and machine learning pipelines.

But when I'm not deciphering data patterns and unravelling insights, you can find me seeking solace in the great outdoors.
