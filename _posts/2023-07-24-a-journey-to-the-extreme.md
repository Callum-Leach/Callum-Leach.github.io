Who wants to be average? To fit perfectly into a trend? Those who dare to explore beyond the ordinary, are the ones to reveal the treasures that lie at the fringes. Let's go down this rabbit hole, and see where it comes out.

## Why do we only study extreme observations?

Phenomena which generate extreme value observations are fundamentally different than those which generate typical values. If we assume that $$X_t$$ has cdf $$F_X(x)$$:

$$F_{M_n}(x) = P(M_n \leq x) = P(X_t \leq x \space \forall t=1,\dots,n)$$
