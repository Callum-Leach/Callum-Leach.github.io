As climate change reshapes our world, extremes in weather are becoming increasing important, especially for sectors like renewable energy. In this research, we explore how the most extreme values of surface winds, solar irradiance and temperature are projected to shift throughout this century under different climate scenarios.

Using data from seven CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs), we studied how these variables-wind speed, solar irradiance and near surface temperatures might change over time, in terms of yearly minima, maxima and averages.
