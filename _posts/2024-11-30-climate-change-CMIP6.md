We assess the strength of evidence in favour of changes in the distributional tail characteristics of wind, solar irradiance
and temperature variables available as output of CMIP6 climate models, due to climate forcing. We estimate global
and climate zone annual maximum and annual mean data for the period (2015, 2100) from daily output of seven
CMIP6 GCMs for the daily wind speed (sfcWind) and maximum wind speed (sfcWindmax), solar irradiance (rsds)
and near-surface temperature (tas) variables.
