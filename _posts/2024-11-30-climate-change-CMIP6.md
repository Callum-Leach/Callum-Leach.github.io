We assess the strength of evidence in favour of changes in the distributional tail characteristics of wind, solar irradiance
and temperature variables available as output of CMIP6 climate models, due to climate forcing. We estimate global
and climate zone annual maximum and annual mean data for the period (2015, 2100) from daily output of seven
CMIP6 GCMs for the daily wind speed (sfcWind) and maximum wind speed (sfcWindmax), solar irradiance (rsds)
and near-surface temperature (tas) variables. We also calculate the corresponding annualised data for individual
locations within neighbourhoods of the North Atlantic and Celtic Sea region. For each data source we access output
corresponding to three climate scenarios and multiple climate ensemble runs. We then estimate non-stationary extreme
value models (GEVR) for annual extremes, and perform non-homogeneous Gaussian regression (NHGR) for annual
means, using Bayesian inference. We use the estimated statistical models to quantify the distribution of (i) the change
in the 100-year return value for annual extremes, and (2) the change in annual mean level, over the period (2025, 2125).
To summarise results, we estimate linear mixed effects models for the observed variation of (i) and (ii). Evidence for
changes in the 100-year return value for annual maxima of wind variables over time and with climate scenario is weak,
in marked contrast to our findings for rsds and tas. For annual means, there is stronger evidence for changes over
time for wind variables, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, but the extent of the changes is small
